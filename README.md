# NN-PID
In this project, I developed a simple neural network to regulate PID controller parameters. 
A simple BP neural network used and the algorithem is based on the following paper:
- Song, Yang, Shenyi Wu, and Yuying Yan. "Development of self-tuning intelligent PID controller based on BPNN for indoor air quality control." International Journal of Emerging Technology and Advanced Engineering 3.11 (2013): 283-290.


Swish activation function used in hidden layer.
